# About the Project 
This is an implementation of the AMAG in pytorch and torch_geometric, from scatch by following [the original paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7ntI4kcoqG). 

# Getting Started 
## Installation 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hglee98/AMAG-Additive-Multiplicative-and-Adaptive-Graph-Neural-Network-For-Forecasting-Neuron-Activity.git
```
## Dataset 
You can get the dataset from [this link](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10139709). And please save them into "./storage/data/".


## Model Training 
```sh
python3 train.py
```
